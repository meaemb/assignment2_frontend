                <p><b><i>The Notebook</i></b> is the debut novel by American novelist Nicholas Sparks. Released in 1996, the romance novel was later adapted into a popular 2004 film of the same name.</p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>This is Nicholas Sparks' first published novel. He wrote it over a period of six months in 1994. It was on The New York Times Best Seller list in its first week of release. The Notebook was a hardcover bestseller for more than a year. In interviews, Sparks said that he had been inspired by the story of his wife's grandparents, who had been married for more than sixty years when he met them. In “The Notebook”, he tried to describe the long romantic love of that couple.
The romantic story of the novel focuses on two main characters Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson. The story that is introduced to the reader is the same one that elderly Noah reads to Allie in a nursing home in their eighties. Allie does not know who Noah is, only that daily he visits her and reads to her. Each night, she forgets who he is and what he has read, and each night Noah hopes that the story will restore her memories and bring her back to him.
The young Allie and Noah meet one summer in the 1930s, in the small town of New Bern, North Carolina. They fall in love and promise that they will never be apart. But at the end of the summer, Allie leaves with her family for fourteen years. He writes to her every month but gets no response. Later she discovers that Noah wrote to her but that her mother hid the letters. Allie’s family is part of the southern aristocracy, and her parents do not believe that the lower-class Noah deserves their daughter.
After fourteen years, Allie returns to New Bern to tell Noah that she is engaged to a charming, handsome attorney named Lon Hammond. But Allie and Noah quickly fall in love again. Allie’s mother figures out why her daughter is in New Bern and visits them at Noah’s house. She gives Allie the letters she hid and tells her to make whatever decision is best for her. That is where Noah ends the story, and the novel returns to the present day.
The most essential motive of the novel is: love overcomes everything. Although this concept is as old as Adam, in this piece of literature, it is the most prevalent theme. In the world of The Notebook, love overcomes all: class, logic, and even disease. No matter how many obstacles Allie and Noah faced, their love always brought them together again. Firstly, they must face the pressures of her parents and their social position. “Most of the summer, she had to make excuses to her parents whenever they wanted to see each other. It wasn't that they didn't like him — it was that he was from a different class, too poor, and they would never approve if their daughter became serious with someone like him. “I don't care what my parents think, I love you and always will,” she would say. “We'll find a way to be together.”
Her mother hid Noah’s letters and even pressured her to give up painting, a talent that Noah had encouraged. Then, they face a fourteen-year-old separation and the Second World War. Also, the engagement to Lon Hamilton, a member of an influential and noble family, distances the lovers. Moreover, their four-year-old son dies. Alzheimer’s disease is the final difficulty. However, nothing can separate them. Allie’s promise that she will return to him always comes true. By showing how love comes to define Noah and Allie’s lives, Sparks suggests that love is a force which can steer one’s destiny.
Another motive is the true wealth.</p>
